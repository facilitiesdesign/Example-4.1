# Example-4.1

Tires and Brakes, Inc., is an automobile service company specializing in tire and brake replacement. It has four service centers and a warehouse in the Detroit metropolitan area. The warehouse supplies tires, brakes, and other components to the service centers. The company manager has determined that he needs to add two more warehouses to improve the component delivery service. At the same time, he wants the location of the two new warehouses to minimize the cost of delivering components from the new warehouses to the existing facilities (four service centers and the existing warehouse) as well as between the new warehouses. The four service centers and warehouse have these coordinate locations—(8, 20), (8, 10), (10, 20), (16, 30), and (35, 20). It is anticipated that there will be one trip per day between the new warehouses. The number of trips between the new warehouses (W1, W2) and four service centers (SC1–SC4) as well as the existing warehouse (SC5) is provided in the matrix in Figure 4.2. Develop a model similar to the transformed model 2 to minimize the distribution cost and solve it using Gurobi or LINGO optimization software.
